<introduction>
  <paragraph>Normal mode registers are used to configure and monitor the
    operation of the device.</paragraph>
  <notes>
    <note>Writing values into unused register bits has no effect. However,
      to ensure software compatibility with future, feature-enhanced versions
      of the product, unused register bits must be written with logic 0.
      Reading back unused bits can produce either a logic 1 or a logic 0;
      hence, unused register bits should be masked off by software when
      read.</note>
    <note>All configuration bits that can be written into can also be read
      back. This allows the processor controlling the device to determine the
      programming state.</note>
    <note>Writeable register bits are cleared to logic 0 upon reset unless
      otherwise noted.</note>
    <note>Writing into read-only normal mode register bit locations does not
      affect device operation unless otherwise noted.</note>
    <note>Certain register bits are reserved. To ensure that the device
      operates as intended, reserved register bits must only be written with
      their default values unless otherwise noted.</note>
    <note>There are several types of register bits throughout the device.
      The R/W register bits are readable and writeable by the microprocessor.
      The R register bits are read-only and may only be read by the
      microprocessor.</note>
    <note>For all register accesses, CSB must be logic 0.</note>

          <paragraph>The PHY Initialization Register is used to configure and control the initialization of the PHY. This includes the triggering of certain initialization routines, as well as the reset of the PHY and/or the PLLs used in the PHY. Any PIR register bit that is used to trigger an initialization routine (bits 0 to 15) is self clearing and will be set to 0 once the initialization is done. Any configuration register write that sets the PIR[INIT] register bit will trigger initialization as selected by the other PIR register bits. The completion status of this initialization can be checked by polling the PHY General Status Register 0 (PGSR0). Note that PGSR0[IDONE] is not cleared immediately after PIR[INIT] is set, and therefore software must wait a minimum of 10 configuration clock cycles from when PIR[INIT] is set to when it starts polling for PGSR0[IDONE].</paragraph>

              <paragraph>Initialization Trigger. A write of 1'b1 to this bit triggers the DDR system initialization, including PHY initialization, DRAM initialization, and PHY training. The exact initialization steps to be executed are specified in bits 1 to 15 of this register. A bit setting of 1 means the step will be executed as part of the initialization sequence, while a setting of 1'b0 means the step will be bypassed. The initialization trigger bit is self-clearing. It is recommended that this bit be set 1'b1 in a separate config write step after other bits in this register have been programmed to avoid any race condition. The PGSR0.IDONE status bit indicates when the initialization steps are complete. Wait at least 32 ctl_clk cycles after PGSR0.IDONE is observed to be 1'b1 before starting or resuming traffic to DRAM. Caution: This bit should be set to 1'b1 to trigger the DDR system initialization only when the DDR/DFI interfaces are idle and DFI update interface is disabled in Controller as well as in PHY (DSGCR.PUREN=0).</paragraph>

Valid values are: - 2'b00 = PUB uses its own refresh period counter to schedule refreshes and generates the refreshes when its refresh counter expires. - 2b'01 = In PUB mode, the PUB snoops the DFI bus for refreshes from the controller and sends those refreshes to the DRAM when it has a slot to do so. In this mode the PUB does not generate its own refreshes. - 2'b10 = PUB snoops the DFI bus for refreshes from the controller only when it is not in PUB mode. It then uses these to reset its own refresh counter so that when it enters PUB mode its refresh counter is synchronized to the controller refresh counter. In this mode the PUB will generate its own refreshes. - 2'b11 = Reserved.</paragraph>

A further 400 clocks must be subtracted from the derived number to account for command flow and missed slots of refreshes in the internal PUB blocks. The default corresponds to DDR3 9*7.8us at 1066MHz when a burst of 9 refreshes are issued at every refresh interval.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>Low Power Wakeup Threshold. If dfi_lp_wakeup is greater than this threshold value, PLLs will be powered down when entering DFI low power mode. The value of the dfi_lp_wakeup signal at the time that the dfi_lp_ctrl_req or dfi_lp_data_req signal is asserted sets the tlp_wakeup time. Valid values in terms of number clock cycles are: - 4'b0000 = tlp_wakeup is 16 cycles - 4'b0001 = tlp_wakeup is 32 cycles - 4'b0010 = tlp_wakeup is 64 cycles - 4'b0011 = tlp_wakeup is 128 cycles - 4'b0100 = tlp_wakeup is 256 cycles - 4'b0101 = tlp_wakeup is 512 cycles - 4'b0110 = tlp_wakeup is 1024 cycles - 4'b0111 = tlp_wakeup is 2048 cycles - 4'b1000 = tlp_wakeup is 4096 cycles - 4'b1001 = tlp_wakeup is 8192 cycles - 4'b1010 = tlp_wakeup is 16384 cycles - 4'b1011 = tlp_wakeup is 32768 cycles - 4'b1100 = tlp_wakeup is 65536 cycles - 4'b1101 = tlp_wakeup is 131072 cycles - 4'b1110 = tlp_wakeup is 262144 cycles - 4'b1111 = tlp_wakeup is unlimited LPWAKEUP_THRSH calculation: - MINIMUM LPWAKEUP CYCLES = pll_lock_time / ctl_clk_period + MDL calibration cycles, where, MDL calibration cycles = N * DDL calibration cycles N is Decoded value of PGCR1.FDEPTH. With tCK= 938 ps; ctl_clk = 1876 ps; and PGCR1.FDEPTH = 2'b10 (PGCR1.FDEPTH=2'b10 decodes to a depth of 8), pll_lock_time from PLL spec is 25us. So LPWAKEUP_THRSH = 25 ns / 1876 ps + 8 * (800 cycles) = 13326 + 6400 = 19726 cycles. Setting LPWAKEUP_THRSH to 4'b1010 would trigger PLL power down for tlp_wakeup value of 32768 cycles and above; which meets the calculations for MINIMUM LPWAKEUP CYCLES of 19726 cycles.</paragraph>

        <reg_description>
          <paragraph>This register configures how ODT should be controlled on the different ranks when writing or reading a particular rank. This provides full flexibility on how the overall termination of the SDRAM system is set depending on how many ranks are used and whether the DIMM slots are occupied or not. For example, assume the system is a 2-rank configuration and during Read commands the user wishes to always enable the ODT on the SDRAM which is not providing the Read data. In this case, the user would write "000000000010" to RDODT of rank 0 and "000000000001" to RDODT of rank 1. The ODTC registers are indirectly accessed. Each rank has its own copy of ODTCR values in the same ODTCR register. These rank-specific register fields can be accessed (written or read) from the register port by specifying the rank in the Rank ID register (RANKIDR). For Direct or Encoded Quad mode, only 2 ODT pins are used for every 4 ranks. ODT[0] is shared between rank 0 and rank 2 and ODT[1] is shared between rank 1 and rank 3 of every DIMM. Therefore the Read ODT must be programmed to reflect this by making sure for every 4 ranks the even ranks match and the odd ranks match. So for an 8 rank system the Read ODT may be as follows - RDODT_rank0 8'b11111010 - RDODT_rank1 8'b11110101 - RDODT_rank2 8'b11111010 - RDODT_rank3 8'b11110101 - RDODT_rank4 8'b10101111 - RDODT_rank5 8'b01011111 - RDODT_rank6 8'b10101111 - RDODT_rank7 8'b01011111 For Shared AC, when setting RDODT, the bit for the rank being accessed must be set to 0. Additionally the bits for all the ranks in the other channel must be set to 0 as well. The ranks that are in the same channel as the one being accessed can be set to 1'b0 or 1'b1.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>Write ODT. Specifies whether ODT should be enabled (1'b1) or disabled (1'b0) on each of the up to 12 ranks when a write command is sent to rank n, n=0 to 11. Each rank has its own 12-bit WRODT field which is indirectly accessed using RANKIDR register. The 12 bits of the field each represent a rank, the LSB being rank 0 and the MSB being rank 11. Default is to enable ODT only on rank being written to. The default shown in this register is for rank 0, the default for the other ranks will have the nth bit set where n corresponds to the number of the rank. For example: - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0xB, then WRODT value after reset = 0x800 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0xA, then WRODT value after reset = 0x400 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0x9, then WRODT value after reset = 0x200 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0x8, then WRODT value after reset = 0x100 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0x7, then WRODT value after reset = 0x080 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0x6, then WRODT value after reset = 0x040 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0x5, then WRODT value after reset = 0x020 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0x4, then WRODT value after reset = 0x010 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0x3, then WRODT value after reset = 0x008 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0x2, then WRODT value after reset = 0x004 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0x1, then WRODT value after reset = 0x002 - If RANKIDR.RANKRID = 0x0, then WRODT value after reset = 0x001</paragraph>

These timing parameters are in DRAM clock cycles and are derived from corresponding parameters in the DRAM datasheet divided by the clock cycle time. Non-integer values should be rounded up to the next integer. All the default values shown in the following tables are in decimal format and correspond to the highest speed the PHY can be compiled for, i.e. JEDEC DDR3-2133N speed grade. This corresponds to DRAM bit rate of 2133Mbps, DRAM clock frequency of 1066MHz, controller clock frequency of 533MHz, and configuration or APB clock frequency of 533MHz.

          <paragraph>These registers are updated after successfully running write eye centering and read eye centering respectively, and indicate the min &amp; max BDL and LCDL values attained during eye centering. The computed write eye center (WDQ LCDL end value) is determined by the formula (DTWBMX + DTWLMX + DTWLMN - DTWBMN) / 2, and the computed read eye center (RDQS LCDL end value) is determined by the formula (DTRBMX + DTRLMX + DTRLMN - DTRBMN) / 2. Note that DTEDR0-2 indicate the delay line values attained for the last rank trained for eye centering. In multi-rank systems, and if the DXCCR.RKLOOP field is 1 (default), ranks are trained in ascending order. In this case, after overall data training completion, the highest enabled system rank will have been trained last, and thus DTEDR0-2 will reflect min and max delay line values for that rank. Disabling rank eye train looping (DXCCR.RKLOOP=0) will cause data eye centering to be run for a single rank, as specified through DTCR.DTRANK; in this case, DTEDR0-2 will reflect the min &amp; max delay line values for that rank. In the event of a data training error in a multi-rank system scenario with rank eye train looping enabled (DXCCR.RKLOOP=1), training is exited upon encounter of the error, and thus DTEDR0-2 will reflect delay line values for the last rank trained (regardless of higher ranks being enabled or not). To read the min/max values for a particular byte lane, first write register DTCR0.DTDBS to select the byte lane and then read these registers.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>Controller Update Dummy Reads. Specifies the number of DQS drift detection dummy reads that the PUB should generate during a controller. This is valid only if the PUB is configured to compensate DQS drift during a controller update (i.e. if CUDFTUP is set). If this value is set to 1'b0, then the PUB will only compensate the drift that was detected prior to the controller update request, which can only be a one-step drift compensation. Each dummy read will detect and compensate further drift.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>DCU Address Register selects the DCU cache and the address of the cache that should be accessed when subsequent configuration writes or reads to the caches is triggered using the DCU Data Register (DCUDR). When read access is specified (ATYPE == 1), a write to the DCUAR will automatically transfer the first cache data word indicated by CWADDR_R/CSADDR_R into the DCU Data Register (DCUDR) and optionally increment the cache address if INCA is set if the cache access is a read. Subsequent reads of the DCUDR will return one incremental cache word slice at a time. DCUDR reads must be spaced at least ((2 x DWC_CDC_SYNC_CYCLES) + 2) clock cycles apart to allow clock domain crossing logic to function correctly. When write access is specified (ATYPE == 0), a write to the DCUAR will automatically transfer the data word in DCUDR into the cache at the address indicated by CWADDR_W/CSADDR_W and optionally increment the cache address if INCA is set. Subsequent writes of the DCUDR will automatically transfer the data word into the next incremental slice of the cache words. DCUDR writes must be spaced at least ((2 x DWC_CDC_SYNC_CYCLES) + 2) clock cycles apart to allow clock domain crossing logic to function correctly.

          <paragraph>BIST error registers are used to return the number of errors on individual data bits of the address/command lane and data byte lane. Bit error registers only return up to 4 errors on the address/command bits and up to 8 errors on the data bits. To diagnose more errors on a bit, use the BIST mask registers to mask all but the bit of interest and re-run the BIST. In this case the word error counter is equal to the bit error counter. Note: Custom pin mapping, if defined does not apply to BIST mode. The address and bank address buses do not, in AC BIST mode, have any other DDR3/2 pins mapped onto any of their comprising bits. So, for example, each BISTBER0.ABER two-bit group corresponds to an address bus signal, regardless of custom pin mapping.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>BIST fail word registers are used to return the last failing word of the address/command lane and data byte lane. Note: Custom pin mapping, if defined, does not apply to BIST mode. The RAS bit status signal below (BISTFWR1.ACTWEBS) is always derived from the looped back ACT_N pin in the PUB macro. In turn, ACT_N always carries the BIST-generated RAS_N signal.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>The rank ID register is used to select the rank register that should be written or read from a configuration port when accessing indirectly-addressed rank registers. Indirectly accessed rank registers appear in the register map as one 32-bit register but internally the register is replicated for up to 12 sets for each of the up to 12 ranks. To access these registers from the configuration register port, the rank number must first be specified in the RANKID register, then a write or read is performed to the memory mapped register to access register bits for the selected rank. Examples of indirectly addressed rank registers are ODTCR, DXnLCDLR0-5 and DXnGTR0. For registers that only hold trained delay values, the rank specified in the RANKDR register to access these values must be the trained rank value. To access ODTCR, the RANKIDR register must hold the physical rank value.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>Set to 1'b0 to disable non-linear compensation for single ended termination. Typically termination calibration is scaled in the PZQ cell to compensate for expected non-linearity between P and N transistors. With single-ended termination, differences between N and P are irrelevant, so this scaling should no longer be applied. To avoid the non-linearity compensation, termination should be trained as if it were an off-chip driver (OCD). Caution: Set this bit to 1'b0 when the PU_ODT_ONLY bit is set to 1'b1.</paragraph>

This will be followed by either a PHY update request to the memory controller or using an incoming DFI control update request. Once the update signal is received, the PVREF and PVREFE IOs will receive the updated impedance calibration code. The limit is specified in terms of binary ZCTRL values. A value of 1'b0 disables the assertion of the IO VT drift status signal.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>PDR Additive Latency. Indicates when the PDR control of DQ/DQS SSTL I/Os is disabled (when the receiver is enabled) during read cycles if dynamic receiver power-down is enabled. Valid values are: - 2'b00 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost three-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost two-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b01 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost three SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost two SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b10 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost two-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost one-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b11 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost two SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble. if dfi is odd read command almost one SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble. Note: For systems that have bigger round trip delay (if DXnGTR0.DGSL value is greater than 2), the PDR times described here will increase by (DXnGTR0.DGSL-2)/2 SDRAM clock cycles. For example, if DXnGCR0.PDRAL PDRAL is set to 2'b00 but DXnGTR0.DGSL = 5, then PDR control is set (receiver is enabled) (3.5 + (5-2)/2) = 5 SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before the read data preamble.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>The DATX bit delay line registers are used to select the delay value on the BDLs used in the DDRPHYDATX8 macros. A single BDL field in the BDLR register connects to a corresponding BDL. The first set of BDLR registers (DXnBDLR0-6) are used for the BDLs of the byte when using the DDRPHYDATX8 macro, or BDLs of the first nibble when using the DATX4X2 macro. The second set (DXnBDLR7-9) have similar usage as the DXnBDLR0-6 but are used for the second nibble when using DDRPHYDATX4X2 macro.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>The DATX8 local calibrated delay line registers are used to select the delay value on the LCDLs used in the DATX8 macros. For the DXnLCDLR0-4, the LCDL value probed or written to in these registers is muxed from/to one of the corresponding rank LCDLs according to the RANKIDR register field. The DXnLCDL registers only hold delays for the trained ranks. To access the delay for a physical rank, the corresponding trained rank number must be programmed into the RANKIDR register. This means to program or read out all rank LCDLs accessible through the DXnLCDLR0-4, a series of two-step writes is required. For example, to program or read out the Read DQS LCDL delay (DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD) in a four-rank system: - 1. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x00 - 2. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 3. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x01 - 4. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 5. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x10 - 6. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 7. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x11 - 8. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD The write data delay (WDQD) and the read DQS delay (RDQSD) are automatically derived from the measured period during calibration. WDQD and RDQSD correspond to a 90 degrees phase shift for DQ during writes and DQS during reads, respectively. The 90 degrees phase shift is used to center DQS into the write and read data eyes. A 90 degrees phase shift is equivalent to half the DDR clock period. After calibration WDQD and RDQSD fields will contain a value that corresponds to half the DDR clock period (or a quarter of the SDRAM clock period). The write leveling delay (RnWLD) and read DQS gating delay DQSGD are derived from the write leveling and DQS training algorithms. These are normally run automatically by the PHY control block or they can be executed in software by the user. After calibration RnWLD field will contain a value that corresponds to the DDR clock period (or half of the SDRAM clock period), while RnDQSGD field will contain a value that corresponds to half the DDR clock period (or a quarter of the SDRAM clock period). After the initial setting, all LCDL register fields are automatically updated by the VT compensation logic to track drifts due to voltage and temperature. The user can however override these values by writing to the respective fields of the register and/or optionally disabling the automatic drift compensation. The first set of LCDLR registers (DXnLCDLR0-5) are used for the LCDLs of the byte when using the DATX8 macro, or LCDLs of the first nibble when using the DATX4X2 macro. The second set (DXnLCDLR6-11) are used for the second nibble when using DATX4X2 macro.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>These are general status registers for the DATX8. They indicate among other things whether write leveling or period measurement calibration is done. Note that WDQCAL, RDQSCAL, RDQSNCAL, GDQSCAL, and WLCAL are calibration measurement-done flags that should be used for debug purposes if the global calibration done flag (PGSR0[CAL]) is not asserted. These flags will typically assert for a minimum of two configuration clock cycles and then de-assert when all measurement done flags are asserted. The first four registers (DXnGSR0-3) are for the byte status when using DATX8, or the status of the first nibble when using DATX4X2. Registers DXnGSR4-5 are for the status of the second nibble when using DATX4X2.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>These are general status registers for the DATX8. They indicate among other things whether write leveling or period measurement calibration is done. Note that WDQCAL, RDQSCAL, RDQSNCAL, GDQSCAL, and WLCAL are calibration measurement-done flags that should be used for debug purposes if the global calibration done flag (PGSR0[CAL]) is not asserted. These flags will typically assert for a minimum of two configuration clock cycles and then de-assert when all measurement done flags are asserted. The first four registers (DXnGSR0-3) are for the byte status when using DATX8, or the status of the first nibble when using DATX4X2. Registers DXnGSR4-5 are for the status of the second nibble when using DATX4X2.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>PDR Additive Latency. Indicates when the PDR control of DQ/DQS SSTL I/Os is disabled (when the receiver is enabled) during read cycles if dynamic receiver power-down is enabled. Valid values are: - 2'b00 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost three-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost two-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b01 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost three SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost two SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b10 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost two-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost one-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b11 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost two SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble. if dfi is odd read command almost one SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble. Note: For systems that have bigger round trip delay (if DXnGTR0.DGSL value is greater than 2), the PDR times described here will increase by (DXnGTR0.DGSL-2)/2 SDRAM clock cycles. For example, if DXnGCR0.PDRAL PDRAL is set to 2'b00 but DXnGTR0.DGSL = 5, then PDR control is set (receiver is enabled) (3.5 + (5-2)/2) = 5 SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before the read data preamble.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>RTT On Additive Latency. Indicates (for the upper nibble) when the ODT control of DQ/DQS SSTL I/Os is asserted during read cycles. Valid values are: - 1'b0 = ODT control is asserted approximately two cycles before its nominal position prior to the read transaction - 1'b1 = ODT control is asserted approximately one cycle before its nominal position prior to the read transaction Note: It is intended to allow the assertion of the ODT signal to be advanced by 1 or 2 cycles.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>RTT Output Hold. Indicates (for the upper nibble) the number of clock cycles (from 0 to 3) after the read transaction the ODT control will remain asserted to the DQS and DQ/DM SSTL IOs when using dynamic ODT control. ODT is deasserted approximately RTTOH clock cycles beyond its nominal position after the read transaction. It is intended to allow the extension of the ODT signal assertion by a few cycles if required.</paragraph>

        <reg_description>
          <paragraph>The DATX bit delay line registers are used to select the delay value on the BDLs used in the DDRPHYDATX8 macros. A single BDL field in the BDLR register connects to a corresponding BDL. The first set of BDLR registers (DXnBDLR0-6) are used for the BDLs of the byte when using the DDRPHYDATX8 macro, or BDLs of the first nibble when using the DATX4X2 macro. The second set (DXnBDLR7-9) have similar usage as the DXnBDLR0-6 but are used for the second nibble when using DDRPHYDATX4X2 macro.</paragraph>

        <reg_description>
          <paragraph>The DATX8 local calibrated delay line registers are used to select the delay value on the LCDLs used in the DATX8 macros. For the DXnLCDLR0-4, the LCDL value probed or written to in these registers is muxed from/to one of the corresponding rank LCDLs according to the RANKIDR register field. The DXnLCDL registers only hold delays for the trained ranks. To access the delay for a physical rank, the corresponding trained rank number must be programmed into the RANKIDR register. This means to program or read out all rank LCDLs accessible through the DXnLCDLR0-4, a series of two-step writes is required. For example, to program or read out the Read DQS LCDL delay (DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD) in a four-rank system: - 1. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x00 - 2. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 3. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x01 - 4. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 5. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x10 - 6. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 7. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x11 - 8. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD The write data delay (WDQD) and the read DQS delay (RDQSD) are automatically derived from the measured period during calibration. WDQD and RDQSD correspond to a 90 degrees phase shift for DQ during writes and DQS during reads, respectively. The 90 degrees phase shift is used to center DQS into the write and read data eyes. A 90 degrees phase shift is equivalent to half the DDR clock period. After calibration WDQD and RDQSD fields will contain a value that corresponds to half the DDR clock period (or a quarter of the SDRAM clock period). The write leveling delay (RnWLD) and read DQS gating delay DQSGD are derived from the write leveling and DQS training algorithms. These are normally run automatically by the PHY control block or they can be executed in software by the user. After calibration RnWLD field will contain a value that corresponds to the DDR clock period (or half of the SDRAM clock period), while RnDQSGD field will contain a value that corresponds to half the DDR clock period (or a quarter of the SDRAM clock period). After the initial setting, all LCDL register fields are automatically updated by the VT compensation logic to track drifts due to voltage and temperature. The user can however override these values by writing to the respective fields of the register and/or optionally disabling the automatic drift compensation. The first set of LCDLR registers (DXnLCDLR0-5) are used for the LCDLs of the byte when using the DATX8 macro, or LCDLs of the first nibble when using the DATX4X2 macro. The second set (DXnLCDLR6-11) are used for the second nibble when using DATX4X2 macro.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>These are general status registers for the DATX8. They indicate among other things whether write leveling or period measurement calibration is done. Note that WDQCAL, RDQSCAL, RDQSNCAL, GDQSCAL, and WLCAL are calibration measurement-done flags that should be used for debug purposes if the global calibration done flag (PGSR0[CAL]) is not asserted. These flags will typically assert for a minimum of two configuration clock cycles and then de-assert when all measurement done flags are asserted. The first four registers (DXnGSR0-3) are for the byte status when using DATX8, or the status of the first nibble when using DATX4X2. Registers DXnGSR4-5 are for the status of the second nibble when using DATX4X2.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>These are general status registers for the DATX8. They indicate among other things whether write leveling or period measurement calibration is done. Note that WDQCAL, RDQSCAL, RDQSNCAL, GDQSCAL, and WLCAL are calibration measurement-done flags that should be used for debug purposes if the global calibration done flag (PGSR0[CAL]) is not asserted. These flags will typically assert for a minimum of two configuration clock cycles and then de-assert when all measurement done flags are asserted. The first four registers (DXnGSR0-3) are for the byte status when using DATX8, or the status of the first nibble when using DATX4X2. Registers DXnGSR4-5 are for the status of the second nibble when using DATX4X2.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>PDR Additive Latency. Indicates when the PDR control of DQ/DQS SSTL I/Os is disabled (when the receiver is enabled) during read cycles if dynamic receiver power-down is enabled. Valid values are: - 2'b00 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost three-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost two-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b01 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost three SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost two SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b10 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost two-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost one-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b11 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost two SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble. if dfi is odd read command almost one SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble. Note: For systems that have bigger round trip delay (if DXnGTR0.DGSL value is greater than 2), the PDR times described here will increase by (DXnGTR0.DGSL-2)/2 SDRAM clock cycles. For example, if DXnGCR0.PDRAL PDRAL is set to 2'b00 but DXnGTR0.DGSL = 5, then PDR control is set (receiver is enabled) (3.5 + (5-2)/2) = 5 SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before the read data preamble.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>The DATX bit delay line registers are used to select the delay value on the BDLs used in the DDRPHYDATX8 macros. A single BDL field in the BDLR register connects to a corresponding BDL. The first set of BDLR registers (DXnBDLR0-6) are used for the BDLs of the byte when using the DDRPHYDATX8 macro, or BDLs of the first nibble when using the DATX4X2 macro. The second set (DXnBDLR7-9) have similar usage as the DXnBDLR0-6 but are used for the second nibble when using DDRPHYDATX4X2 macro.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>The DATX8 local calibrated delay line registers are used to select the delay value on the LCDLs used in the DATX8 macros. For the DXnLCDLR0-4, the LCDL value probed or written to in these registers is muxed from/to one of the corresponding rank LCDLs according to the RANKIDR register field. The DXnLCDL registers only hold delays for the trained ranks. To access the delay for a physical rank, the corresponding trained rank number must be programmed into the RANKIDR register. This means to program or read out all rank LCDLs accessible through the DXnLCDLR0-4, a series of two-step writes is required. For example, to program or read out the Read DQS LCDL delay (DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD) in a four-rank system: - 1. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x00 - 2. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 3. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x01 - 4. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 5. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x10 - 6. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 7. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x11 - 8. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD The write data delay (WDQD) and the read DQS delay (RDQSD) are automatically derived from the measured period during calibration. WDQD and RDQSD correspond to a 90 degrees phase shift for DQ during writes and DQS during reads, respectively. The 90 degrees phase shift is used to center DQS into the write and read data eyes. A 90 degrees phase shift is equivalent to half the DDR clock period. After calibration WDQD and RDQSD fields will contain a value that corresponds to half the DDR clock period (or a quarter of the SDRAM clock period). The write leveling delay (RnWLD) and read DQS gating delay DQSGD are derived from the write leveling and DQS training algorithms. These are normally run automatically by the PHY control block or they can be executed in software by the user. After calibration RnWLD field will contain a value that corresponds to the DDR clock period (or half of the SDRAM clock period), while RnDQSGD field will contain a value that corresponds to half the DDR clock period (or a quarter of the SDRAM clock period). After the initial setting, all LCDL register fields are automatically updated by the VT compensation logic to track drifts due to voltage and temperature. The user can however override these values by writing to the respective fields of the register and/or optionally disabling the automatic drift compensation. The first set of LCDLR registers (DXnLCDLR0-5) are used for the LCDLs of the byte when using the DATX8 macro, or LCDLs of the first nibble when using the DATX4X2 macro. The second set (DXnLCDLR6-11) are used for the second nibble when using DATX4X2 macro.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>These are general status registers for the DATX8. They indicate among other things whether write leveling or period measurement calibration is done. Note that WDQCAL, RDQSCAL, RDQSNCAL, GDQSCAL, and WLCAL are calibration measurement-done flags that should be used for debug purposes if the global calibration done flag (PGSR0[CAL]) is not asserted. These flags will typically assert for a minimum of two configuration clock cycles and then de-assert when all measurement done flags are asserted. The first four registers (DXnGSR0-3) are for the byte status when using DATX8, or the status of the first nibble when using DATX4X2. Registers DXnGSR4-5 are for the status of the second nibble when using DATX4X2.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>These are general status registers for the DATX8. They indicate among other things whether write leveling or period measurement calibration is done. Note that WDQCAL, RDQSCAL, RDQSNCAL, GDQSCAL, and WLCAL are calibration measurement-done flags that should be used for debug purposes if the global calibration done flag (PGSR0[CAL]) is not asserted. These flags will typically assert for a minimum of two configuration clock cycles and then de-assert when all measurement done flags are asserted. The first four registers (DXnGSR0-3) are for the byte status when using DATX8, or the status of the first nibble when using DATX4X2. Registers DXnGSR4-5 are for the status of the second nibble when using DATX4X2.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>RTT Output Hold. Indicates the number of clock cycles (from 0 to 3) after the read data post amble for which ODT control should remain set to DQSODT for DQS or DQODT for DQ/DM before disabling it (setting it to 1'b0) when using dynamic ODT control. ODT is disabled almost RTTOH clock cycles after the read post amble.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>PDR Additive Latency. Indicates when the PDR control of DQ/DQS SSTL I/Os is disabled (when the receiver is enabled) during read cycles if dynamic receiver power-down is enabled. Valid values are: - 2'b00 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost three-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost two-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b01 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost three SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost two SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b10 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost two-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble if dfi is odd read command almost one-and-half SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble - 2'b11 = PDR control is set to 1'b0 (i.e. receiver is enabled) If dfi is even read command, almost two SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble. if dfi is odd read command almost one SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before read data preamble. Note: For systems that have bigger round trip delay (if DXnGTR0.DGSL value is greater than 2), the PDR times described here will increase by (DXnGTR0.DGSL-2)/2 SDRAM clock cycles. For example, if DXnGCR0.PDRAL PDRAL is set to 2'b00 but DXnGTR0.DGSL = 5, then PDR control is set (receiver is enabled) (3.5 + (5-2)/2) = 5 SDRAM clock (CK) cycles before the read data preamble.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>The DATX bit delay line registers are used to select the delay value on the BDLs used in the DDRPHYDATX8 macros. A single BDL field in the BDLR register connects to a corresponding BDL. The first set of BDLR registers (DXnBDLR0-6) are used for the BDLs of the byte when using the DDRPHYDATX8 macro, or BDLs of the first nibble when using the DATX4X2 macro. The second set (DXnBDLR7-9) have similar usage as the DXnBDLR0-6 but are used for the second nibble when using DDRPHYDATX4X2 macro.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>The DATX8 local calibrated delay line registers are used to select the delay value on the LCDLs used in the DATX8 macros. For the DXnLCDLR0-4, the LCDL value probed or written to in these registers is muxed from/to one of the corresponding rank LCDLs according to the RANKIDR register field. The DXnLCDL registers only hold delays for the trained ranks. To access the delay for a physical rank, the corresponding trained rank number must be programmed into the RANKIDR register. This means to program or read out all rank LCDLs accessible through the DXnLCDLR0-4, a series of two-step writes is required. For example, to program or read out the Read DQS LCDL delay (DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD) in a four-rank system: - 1. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x00 - 2. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 3. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x01 - 4. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 5. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x10 - 6. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD - 7. Set the RANKIDR field to 0x11 - 8. Program or read out DXnLCDLR3.RDQSD The write data delay (WDQD) and the read DQS delay (RDQSD) are automatically derived from the measured period during calibration. WDQD and RDQSD correspond to a 90 degrees phase shift for DQ during writes and DQS during reads, respectively. The 90 degrees phase shift is used to center DQS into the write and read data eyes. A 90 degrees phase shift is equivalent to half the DDR clock period. After calibration WDQD and RDQSD fields will contain a value that corresponds to half the DDR clock period (or a quarter of the SDRAM clock period). The write leveling delay (RnWLD) and read DQS gating delay DQSGD are derived from the write leveling and DQS training algorithms. These are normally run automatically by the PHY control block or they can be executed in software by the user. After calibration RnWLD field will contain a value that corresponds to the DDR clock period (or half of the SDRAM clock period), while RnDQSGD field will contain a value that corresponds to half the DDR clock period (or a quarter of the SDRAM clock period). After the initial setting, all LCDL register fields are automatically updated by the VT compensation logic to track drifts due to voltage and temperature. The user can however override these values by writing to the respective fields of the register and/or optionally disabling the automatic drift compensation. The first set of LCDLR registers (DXnLCDLR0-5) are used for the LCDLs of the byte when using the DATX8 macro, or LCDLs of the first nibble when using the DATX4X2 macro. The second set (DXnLCDLR6-11) are used for the second nibble when using DATX4X2 macro.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>These are general status registers for the DATX8. They indicate among other things whether write leveling or period measurement calibration is done. Note that WDQCAL, RDQSCAL, RDQSNCAL, GDQSCAL, and WLCAL are calibration measurement-done flags that should be used for debug purposes if the global calibration done flag (PGSR0[CAL]) is not asserted. These flags will typically assert for a minimum of two configuration clock cycles and then de-assert when all measurement done flags are asserted. The first four registers (DXnGSR0-3) are for the byte status when using DATX8, or the status of the first nibble when using DATX4X2. Registers DXnGSR4-5 are for the status of the second nibble when using DATX4X2.</paragraph>

          <paragraph>These are general status registers for the DATX8. They indicate among other things whether write leveling or period measurement calibration is done. Note that WDQCAL, RDQSCAL, RDQSNCAL, GDQSCAL, and WLCAL are calibration measurement-done flags that should be used for debug purposes if the global calibration done flag (PGSR0[CAL]) is not asserted. These flags will typically assert for a minimum of two configuration clock cycles and then de-assert when all measurement done flags are asserted. The first four registers (DXnGSR0-3) are for the byte status when using DATX8, or the status of the first nibble when using DATX4X2. Registers DXnGSR4-5 are for the status of the second nibble when using DATX4X2.</paragraph>
